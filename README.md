# How to Play
In Minicraft Plus your goal is to defeat the evil Air Wizard who soars high above. However, to defeat him you will need to adventure deep into caves to find resources, craft items, and build your arsenal. Here is a short guide on how to play.

First, you need to create a world. Each world is generated randomly, so you might need to try multiple times to find an ideal start. You can use WASD or the arrow keys to move, and Space/Enter/Z or C/X/Z to perform actions in the game.

# First Things First
Your first goal is to collect wood. Head up to a tree and hit it with Space/C. Hitting it quick is not always the best choice, because it can use up your energy quicker. So it's best to wait a second between hits so your energy can recharge.

Once you have some wood you can place your workbench down by hitting Enter/X and using the arrows to highlight it. Next, select Space/C to equip it, and you will see it equipped in the black bar at the bottom of the screen. The workbench should be over your head.

You can place the workbench down by hitting Space/C. Move up to the workbench and hit Enter/X to display the crafting menu. You can also use the Z menu to find some other crafting recipes that might not be on the crafting table.

# Home Sweet Home
You can build houses by using the Spade (Shovel) to dig a hole. Then craft and place planks into those holes. After that, you can put plank walls or doors onto the planks in the ground. It's a good way to build a safe base.

Night will come soon, so get your base set up. You’ll find that on the first day, you can live unopposed, but after that, you may encounter evil creatures lurking around!

Find the resouces you need to craft items and upgrade your gear. You can punch rocks, but it's best to make a wood pick. As you’re mining rock, look for stairs heading down. That is your way into the caves.

# Let's Go Spelunking!
Caves are hard and the creatures get tougher. You can use your spade to dig around the stairs because creatures don't like the holes and will not cross them. It’s also good for creating safe paths. The first cave layer is iron, and it looks like spiky rocks. The next layer down (look for more stairs down in the iron cave) is gold, which is better than iron, and the next level down is diamond.

If you feel lucky you can try to go down into the dungeons below that. However, with a diamond pick you are ready to open the mountain and take the stairs up to the clouds (the mountain is a square around stairs heading up on the level with trees). You can only break its special rocks with a diamond pick.

# To Battle!
Search the clouds and look for the Air Wizard. He is a tough boss with some strong attacks and abilities. Beat him and win, or explore the dungeons deep underground for more rewards.

Be sure to share this game with your friends. See if they can take on the Air Wizard and save the day!
