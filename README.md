# MiniCraftLauncherIndex
Index files for my Minicraft+ launcher that supports mods. READ: MINICRAFT NOT MINECRAFT

# What's here currently
`release.index` and `dev.index` have download information for the release and pre-release versions of [MiniCraft+](https://github.com/chrisj42/minicraft-plus-revived), respectively.

`mods.index` contains links to different mods i archived on google drive. If the amount of download attempts gets limited, I'll upload them here.
